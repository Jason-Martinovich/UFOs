# UFOs
## Overview 
The purpose of this project was to build a dynamic webpage that allows users to interact with the site by filtering search criteria.  Users can filter UFO sightings based on dates, city, state, country and shape.  With each input the webpage will update accordingly to display available information in the table.

## Results
### Homepage
When the site visitor first lands on the homepage it appears like this and contains the full list of available UFO sightings in the table.

## Summary
~ A drawback of this webpage design is that the user wouldn't know all the avaialbe search options for filtering.  For example to pick a shape, the user would have to search through the table to see what are all the options avaialbe to filter through.  It's not an exactly effeciant way to research the website. 

~One way to fix this would be to include a drop-down lists including all filter options in place of the input fields.
Each list would need to update after a parameter is selected in any filter.

~Another recommendation would be to also include a clear filter button to reset the search table.  This can be the last item in the filter search feild.
